# The Silver Garden

	Welcome to the Silver Garden Programming Language.
this language has a long history, as it had about 5 different 
predecessors. (all predecessors failed, only 2 of them actually
ended up being usable...) it started as NML, then Naramin, and
then NAML, and recently, MerryLang. from MerryLang to Shinoa,
and from Shinoa. to Reisen. and from Reisen, to what you have today.
