# Welcome to the Reisen Programming Language.

A TypeScript and C# inspired programming language
and fear not, to make everything better, proprietary! (just kidding, its not proprietary :])

i'm still working on it so there's no reason to make any examples because this thing is contantly under changes.
being inspired in typescript and C# is the original idea.
butttttt you can check the "Example.reisen" and see how it looks like.
